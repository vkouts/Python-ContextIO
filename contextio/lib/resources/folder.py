                result. Since message bodies must be retrieved from the IMAP
                server, expect a performance hit when setting this parameter.

                parts of a given MIME-type (for example text/html)
            include_headers: mixed - Can be set to 0 (default), 1 or raw. If
                set to 1, complete message headers, parsed into an array, are

                a performance hit when setting this parameter.
            include_flags: integer - Set to 1 to include IMAP flags for this
                message in the result. Since message flags must be retrieved
                from the IMAP server, expect a performance hit when setting
                this parameter.
            flag_seen: integer - Set to 1 to restrict list to messages having
                the \Seen flag set, set to 0 to have the messages with that
                flag unset (ie. list unread messages in the folder).
            limit: integer - The maximum number of results to return.
            offset: integer - Start the list at this offset (zero-based).

        Optional Arguments:
            include_body: integer - Set to 1 to include message bodies in the
                result. Since message bodies must be retrieved from the IMAP
                server, expect a performance hit when setting this parameter.
            include_headers: mixed - Can be set to 0 (default), 1 or raw. If
                set to 1, complete message headers, parsed into an array, are
                included in the results. If set to raw, the headers are also
                included but as a raw unparsed string. Since full original
                headers bodies must be retrieved from the IMAP server, expect
                a performance hit when setting this parameter.
            include_flags: integer - Set to 1 to include IMAP flags of
                messages in the result. Since message flags must be retrieved
                from the IMAP server, expect a performance hit when setting
                this parameter.
            body_type: string - Used when include_body is set to get only body
                parts of a given MIME-type (for example text/html)
            limit: integer - The maximum number of messages to include in the
                messages property of the response.
            offset: integer - Start the list of messages at this offset
                (zero-based).
